# World_Weather_Analysis
Generate destinations and travel maps using Google Maps Platform APIs.
# Project Overview
PlanMyTrip app is an excellent travel and weather app that requires adding the weather description to the weather data.
This requires to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
Next from the list of potential travel destinations, the customer will now be able to choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, customer will be able to create a travel route between their chosen four cities for travel as well as a marker layer map.
Upon completion this Analysis will enhance the user interface and functionality of the PlanMyTrip app.

#There are 3 main interface enhancements that will be seen in the PlanMyTrip App at the end of this project
1. A weather descrription to the weather data,
2. A functional customer Vacation Search map,
3. A vacation itinerary map of 4 cities [for demo in this project] that the customer would like to visit.


## Resources Utilized to Complete Analysis
CSV Files: Weather_Database.csv, WeatherPy_vacation.csv

Jupyter Notebook Files:: Weather_Database.ipynb, Vacation_Search.ipynb, Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb

Python, Anaconda Navigator, Pandas, Matplotlib, CitiPy, SciPy, APIs, JSON, Numpy, Open Weather API, Google Maps API, Regression Analysis

## Retrieve Weather Data 
### Purpose: Retrieve Weather Data
The first part of this project will generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the use of OpenWeatherMap API's. In addition to the city weather data  we will retrieve the current weather description for each city. Last i will, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

## Vacation Search
### Purpose: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map 

This report is created to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
List of deliverables in this report:-
1. For place of travel there is customers minimum and maximum temperature preferences for the cities the would like to visit.
2. The hotel name is shown per travel city.
3. A marker layer map with pop-up markers for the cities in the vacation is illustrated showing -
- Hotel name
- City
- Country
- Current weather description with the maximum temperature

## Vacation Itinerary
### Purpose: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

In this Analysis with the use of Google Directions API i have created a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, i added a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the customers itinerary.
1. Four DataFrames are created, one for each city on the itinerary.
2. The latitude and longitude pairs for each of the four cities are depicted.
3. A directions layer map between the cities and the travel map is shown. 
4. A DataFrame that contains the four cities on the itinerary is shown.
5. A marker layer map with a pop-up marker for the cities on the itinerary is seen. 
Each marker has the following information: 
- Hotel name
- City
- Country
- Current weather description with the maximum temperature

## Scatter Plots
The use of scatter plots in this analysis is to write a summary report on how different weather parameters change based on the latitude.
the images below have depicted a series of scatter plots for each weather parameter against latitude vs. maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed for all the cities.
