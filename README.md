## Scatter Plots
The use of scatter plots in this analysis is to write a summary report on how different weather parameters change based on the latitude.
the images below have depicted a series of scatter plots for each weather parameter against latitude vs. maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed for all the cities.
